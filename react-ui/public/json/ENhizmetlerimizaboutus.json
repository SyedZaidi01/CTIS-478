Principles… Knowing some of the principles of the Industry 4.0 system will be valuable information in terms of understanding what it aims. For example, the principle of interoperability refers to the communication between robot and machine. It is a principle that meets the robot's communication with the system owner in case the machine optimizes itself, which does not require outside intervention, but remains unsolved in any issue. Communication between human and robot is provided by the principle of virtualization. It is an autonomous system and intervenes in the entire production process in a smart factory based on the data obtained by data analytics study.
